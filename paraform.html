 The World Wide Web is a constantly evolving network that has already traveled far
 beyond its conception in the early 1990s, when it was created to solve a specific problem.
 State-of-the-art experiments at CERN (the European Laboratory for Particle Physics—
 now best known as the operator of the Large Hadron Collider) were producing incred
ible amounts of data—so much that the data was proving unwieldy to distribute to the
 participating scientists who were spread out across the world
         <p>
 At this time, the Internet was already in place, with several hundred thousand computers
 connected to it, so Tim Berners-Lee (a CERN fellow) devised a method of navigating
 between them using a hyperlinking framework, which came to be known as Hypertext
 Transfer Protocol, or HTTP. He also created a markup language called HTML, or
 Hypertext Markup Language. To bring these together, he wrote the first web browser
 and web server, tools that we now take for granted.
         <p>
 But back then, the concept was revolutionary. The most connectivity so far experienced
 by at-home modem users was dialing up and connecting to a bulletin board that was
 hosted by a single computer, where you could communicate and swap data only with
 other users of that service. Consequently, you needed to be a member of many bulletin
 board systems in order to effectively communicate electronically with your colleagues
 and friends.
         <p>
 But Berners-Lee changed all that in one fell swoop, and by the mid-1990s, there were
 three major graphical web browsers competing for the attention of five million users.
 It soon became obvious, though, that something was missing. Yes, pages of text and
 graphics with hyperlinks to take you to other pages was a brilliant concept, but the results
 didn’t reflect the instantaneous potential of computers and the Internet to meet the
 particular needs of each user with dynamically changing content. Using the Web was a
 very dry and plain experience, even if we did now have scrolling text and animated
 GIFs!
